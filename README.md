# Record It

**Record It** is a React-Native mobile application, giving musicians better organization over their song ideas. The app provides most of the value of a traditional recording app, with the added benefit of being able to use folders extensively throughout the app. This allows musicians to have a more clear idea of what they have to work with so that they can accumulate ideas and implement them more effectively.
